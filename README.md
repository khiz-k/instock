Project no. 4 of the BrainStation 2020 Full-Time Online Web Development curriculum.

## Project Overview

Having completed a few projects thus far, you are now ready to take on more complex work. Your task is to work with an assigned team to develop an inventory management system for a Fortune 500 client. The client’s existing system is slow, unresponsive, and difficult to scale causing employees to have to use Excel. This is not acceptable going forward, so they need an upgrade that will be easier for employees to use, and can be scaled as needed in the future.

You and your team will be building a web application called ‘InStock’ from the ground-up, and a project manager has already set up a JIRA board with the required tasks outlined. You will need to assign different tasks to each team member and manage your code base to collaborate together effectively.

## Project Management and Team Requirements

- Attend daily stand-ups with your team.
- Complete assigned JIRA tickets.
- You must follow the instructions available in JIRA.
- Your JIRA board must be complete.
- Each ticket must go through every column to indicate the stage of completion.
- At each stage of completion, you must provide a detailed comment to communicate effectively to the rest of your team.
- Provide detailed git commit messages on all tasks. There should be at least one Git commit for each task that you have been assigned. This blog post provides a good breakdown on Git Commit Message Best Practices.
- Pull requests must have a small description indicating work completed and merge conflicts must be handled by the individual creating the pull request.

## Functional Requirements

- All requirements as specified in the JIRA tickets must be completed without bugs. Make sure you and your team members test tickets before moving them to the ‘done’ column.

## Visual Design Requirements

The site should be responsive and therefore closely resemble the provided mockups.

## Implementation Requirements

- The site must use multiple routes.
- You must use the react-switch npm package wherever a toggle switch is indicated on the mockup.
- You must create React components as appropriate, and use state/props to make the user interface dynamic.
