<h4 align="center">Inventory management system in the form of a web application</h4>
<h2 align="center">Project Overview</h2>
<p align="center">
Task is to work with an assigned team to develop an inventory management system for a Fortune 500 client. The client’s existing system is slow, unresponsive, and difficult to scale causing employees to have to use Excel. This is not acceptable going forward, so they need an upgrade that will be easier for employees to use, and can be scaled as needed in the future.

You and your team will be building a web application called ‘InStock’ from the ground-up, and a project manager has already set up a JIRA board with the required tasks outlined. You will need to assign different tasks to each team member and manage your code base to collaborate together effectively.
